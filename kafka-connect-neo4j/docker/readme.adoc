# Build it locally

Build the project by running the following command:

    $ mvn clean install

Inside the directory <neo4j-streams>/kafka-connect-neo4j/target` you'll find a file named `kafka-connect-neo4j-<VERSION>.tar.gz`


# Configuring the stack

Create a directory `plugins` at the same level of the compose file and unzip the file `kafka-connect-neo4j-<VERSION>.tar.gz` inside it, then start the compose file

    $ docker-compose up -d

Create the Sink instance:

We'll define the Sink configuration as follows:

[source,json]
----
include::contrib.sink.neo4j.json[]
----

In particular this line:

----
"neo4j.topic.cypher.my-topic": "MERGE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname}) MERGE (f:Family{name: event.surname}) MERGE (p)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f)"
----

defines that all the data that comes from the topic `neo4j` will be unpacked by the Sink into Neo4j with the following Cypher query:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname})
MERGE (f:Family{name: event.surname})
MERGE (p)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f)
----


Under the hood the Sink inject the event object in this way

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND {batch} AS event
MERGE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname})
MERGE (f:Family{name: event.surname})
MERGE (p)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f)
----

Where `{batch}` is a list of event objects.

You can change the query or remove the property and add your own, but you must follow the following convention:

[source,javascript]
----
"neo4j.topic.cypher.<YOUR_TOPIC>": "<YOUR_CYPHER_QUERY>"
----

Let's load the configuration into the Confluent Platform with this REST call:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
  -H 'Accept:application/json' \
  -d @contrib.sink.avro.neo4j.json
----

The file `contrib.sink.string-json.neo4j.json` contains a configuration that manage a simple JSON producer example

Please check that everything is fine by going into:

http://localhost:9021/management/connect

and click to the **Sink** tab. You must find a table just like this:

[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Active Tasks
|Name
|Topics

|Running
|1
|Neo4jSinkConnector
|my-topic
|===

Now you can send your AVRO data to the `my-topic` topic
