Kafka Connect, an open source component of Apache Kafka, is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems.

The Neo4j Streams project provides a Kafka Connect plugin that can be installed into the Confluent Platform enabling:

- Ingest data from Kafka topics directly into Neo4j via templated Cypher queries;
- Stream Neo4j transaction events (*coming soon*).

=== Docker compose file

Inside the directory `/kafka-connect-neo4j/docker` you'll find a compose file that allows you to start the whole testing environment:

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../kafka-connect-neo4j/docker/docker-compose.yml[]
----

include::../../../kafka-connect-neo4j/docker/readme.adoc[]

=== Monitor via Confluent Platform UI

The Kafka Monitoring UI can be found at http://<localhost>:9021/management/connect

They show up properly in my topic, and then are added to Neo4j via the sink.

Below you see the data that has been ingested into Neo4j. During my testing I got up to more than 2M events.
