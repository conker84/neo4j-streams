Kafka Connect, an open source component of Apache Kafka, is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems.

The Neo4j Streams project provides a Kafka Connect plugin that can be installed into the Confluent Platform enabling:

- Ingest data from Kafka topics directly into Neo4j via templated Cypher queries;
- Stream Neo4j transaction events (*coming soon*).

=== Plugin installation

You can choose your preferred way in order to install the plugin

==== Download and install the plugin via Confluent Hub client

If you are using the provided compose file you can easily install the plugin by using the Confluent Hub.

They show up properly in my topic, and then are added to Neo4j via the sink.

Below you see the data that has been ingested into Neo4j. During my testing I got up to more than 2M events.
