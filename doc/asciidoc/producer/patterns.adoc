To control which nodes are sent to Kafka, and which of their properties you can define node-patterns in the config.

You can chose Labels and properties for inclusion or exclusion, with `+*+` meaning *all*.

Patterns are separated by semicolons `;`.

The basic syntax is:

----
Label{*};Label1{prop1, prop2};Label3{-prop1,-prop2}
----

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]

| pattern
| meaning

| Label{*}
| all nodes with this label with all their properties go to the related topic

| Label1:Label2
| nodes with these two labels are sent to the related topic

| Label{prop1,prop2}
| the prop1, prop2 of all nodes with this label are sent to the related topic

| Label{-prop1,-prop2}
| properties of the node with prop1, prop2 excluded, with the label are sent to the related topic
