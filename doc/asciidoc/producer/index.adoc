== Neo4j Streams Producer

Is the transaction event handler events that sends data to a Kafka topic

=== Configuration

You can set the following configuration values in your `neo4j.conf`, here are the defaults.

.neo4j.conf
----
kafka.zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
kafka.acks=1
kafka.num.partitions=1
kafka.retries=2
kafka.batch.size=16384
kafka.buffer.memory=33554432
kafka.reindex.batch.size=1000
kafka.session.timeout.ms=15000
kafka.connection.timeout.ms=10000
kafka.replication=1

kafka.topics=neo4j
kafka.patterns=neo4j:*
----

See the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs[Apache Kafka documentation] for details on these settings.

=== Patterns

To control which nodes are sent to Kafka, and which of their properties you can define node-patterns in the config.

You can chose Labels and properties for inclusion or exclusion, with `+*+` meaning *all*.

Patterns are separated by semicolons `;`.

The basic syntax is:

----
kafka.topics=topic1,topic2
kafka.patterns=topic1:*;topic2:Label1{prop1, prop2}, topic1:Label1:Label2{*,-prop1}, topic2:Label3{-prop1,-prop2,prop3}
----

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| topic:*
| all nodes go to this topic

| topic:Label
| all nodes with this label with all their properties go to this topic

| topic:Label{*}
| all nodes with this label with all their properties go to this topic

| topic:Label1:Label2
| nodes with these two labels are sent to this topic

| topic1:Label1;topic2:Label2
| nodes with Label1 are sent to topic1, nodes with Label2 are sent to topic2

| topic:Label{prop1,prop2}
| the prop1, prop2 of all nodes with this label are sent to the topic

| topic:Label{-prop1,-prop2}
| properties of the node with prop1, prop2 excluded, with the label are sent to the topic

|===

=== Events

The Producer streams three kind of events:

* *created*: when a node/relation/property is created
* *updated*: when a node/relation/property is updated
* *deleted*: when a node/relation/property is deleted

==== Created

Following an example of the node creation event:

```json
include::data/node.created.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.created.json[]
```

==== Updated

Following an example of the node update event:

```json
include::data/node.updated.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.updated.json[]
```

==== Deleted

Following an example of the node creation event:

```json
include::data/node.deleted.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.deleted.json[]
```

=== Meta

The *meta* field contains the metadata related to the transaction event:

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*timestamp*
|Number
|The timestamp related to the transaction event

|*username*
|String
|The username that generated the transaction

|*tx_id*
|Number
|The transaction id provided by the Neo4j trasaction manager

|*tx_event_count*
|Number
|The number of the events included into the transaction (i.e. 2 update on nodes, 1 relationship creation)

|*tx_event_id*
|Number
|The id of the event inside the transaction

|*operation*
|enum["created", "updated", "deleted"]
|The operation type

|*source*
|Object
|Contains the information about the source
|===

==== Source

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

=== Payload

The *payload* field contains the information about the the data related to the event

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number
|The id of the graph entity

|*type*
|enum["node", "relationship"]
|The type of the graph entity

|*before*
|Object
|The data before the transaction event

|*after*
|Object
|The data after the transaction event
|===

==== Payload: before and after

We must distinguish two cases:

===== Nodes

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*labels*
|String[]
|List of labels attached to the node

|*properties*
|Map<K, V>
|List of properties attached to the node, the Key is the property name
|===

===== Relationships

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*type*
|string
|The relationship type

|*properties*
|Map<K,V>
|List of properties attached to the relationship, the Key is the property name

|*startNode*
|Object
|The starting node of the relationship

|*endNode*
|Object

|===

====== Relationships: startNode and endNode

|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number

|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*before*

|===

==== Schema: before and after

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description
