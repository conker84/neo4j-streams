== Neo4j Streams Producer

Is the transaction event handler events that sends data to a Kafka topic

=== Configuration

include::configuration.adoc[]

=== Patterns

include::patterns.adoc[]

=== Procedures

The producer comes out with a list of procedures.
Because of they use internal Neo4j API you must allow them with the following configuration paramater

 dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=streams.*

If you are using them via Docker, pass this simple environment parameter:

 NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted: streams.*


==== streams.publish

This procedure allows custom message streaming from Neo4j to the configured environment

Uses:

`CALL streams.publish('my-topic', 'Hello World from Neo4j!')`

The message retrieved from the Consumer is the following:

`{"payload":"Hello world from Neo4j!"}`

Input Parameters:

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Type
|Description
|`topic`
|String
|The topic where you want to publish the data

|`payload`
|Object
|The data that you want to stream

|===

You can send any kind of data in the payload, nodes, relationships, paths, lists, maps, scalar values and nested versions thereof.

=== Transaction Event Handler

The transaction event handler is the core of the Stream Producer and allows to stream database changes.

==== Events

The Producer streams three kind of events:

* *created*: when a node/relation/property is created
* *updated*: when a node/relation/property is updated
* *deleted*: when a node/relation/property is deleted

===== Created

Following an example of the node creation event:

```json
include::data/node.created.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.created.json[]
```

===== Updated

Following an example of the node update event:

```json
include::data/node.updated.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.updated.json[]
```

===== Deleted

Following an example of the node creation event:

```json
include::data/node.deleted.json[]
```

```json
include::data/relationship.deleted.json[]
```

==== Meta

The *meta* field contains the metadata related to the transaction event:

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*timestamp*
|Number
|The timestamp related to the transaction event

|*username*
|String
|The username that generated the transaction

|*tx_id*
|Number
|The transaction id provided by the Neo4j trasaction manager

|*tx_event_count*
|Number
|The number of the events included into the transaction (i.e. 2 update on nodes, 1 relationship creation)

|*tx_event_id*
|Number
|The id of the event inside the transaction

|*operation*
|enum["created", "updated", "deleted"]
|The operation type

|*source*
|Object
|Contains the information about the source
|===

===== Source

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*hostname*
|String
|The information about the source
|===


==== Payload

The *payload* field contains the information about the the data related to the event

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number
|The id of the graph entity

|*type*
|enum["node", "relationship"]
|The type of the graph entity

|*before*
|Object
|The data before the transaction event

|*after*
|Object
|The data after the transaction event
|===

===== Payload: before and after

We must distinguish two cases:

====== Nodes

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*labels*
|String[]
|List of labels attached to the node

|*properties*
|Map<K, V>
|List of properties attached to the node, the Key is the property name
|===

====== Relationships

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*label*
|string
|The relationship type

|*properties*
|Map<K,V>
|List of properties attached to the relationship, the Key is the property name

|*start*
|Object
|The starting node of the relationship

|*end*
|Object
|The ending node of the relationship
|===

====== Relationships: startNode and endNode

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number
|The id of the node

|*labels*
|String[]
|List of labels attached to the node
|===


==== Schema

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*before*
|Object
|The schema before the transaction event

|*after*
|Object
|The schema after the transaction event
|===

===== Schema: before and after

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*before*
|Object
|The schema before the transaction event

|*after*
|Object
|The schema after the transaction event
|===

We must distinguish two cases:

====== Nodes

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*constraints*
|Object[]
|List of constraints attached to the node

|*properties*
|Map<K, V>

====== Constraints

Nodes and Relationships can have a list of constraints attached to them:

.Node Constraints
[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*label*
|String
|The label attached to the constraint

|*type*
|enum["NODE_KEY", "UNIQUENESS", "RELATIONSHIP_PROPERTY_EXISTENCE", "NODE_PROPERTY_EXISTENCE"]
